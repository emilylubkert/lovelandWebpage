<h1>Ski At Loveland!</h1>
<h2>World-Class Skiing, just 45 minutes from Denver</h2>
<p>Loveland Ski Area is a <strong>great</strong> place to ski. It has 2 main area: the Valley, which is perfect for beginners and families, and the Basin, which has trails for all levels. At the Basin, you get started by heading up the high-speed lift, Chet's Dream. From there, the possibilities for what's next seem endless!</p>
